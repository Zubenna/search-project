# Overview
This is a search page that uses torre api to pull information from torre website. When the project is set up and running, the user can enter the name of the person to be searched in the search bar. While the user is typing the name, the app filters the list according to the letters in the name. Ten simmilar names are listed as the user searches. From the listed user, the searcher can now select and click the identified user he wants. The app has a backend built with NodeJS to handle the route and call the torre api to retrieve the list of matched users. The front end is built with ReactJs to accept the user input and pass it to the backenf for searching and filtering. When you clicked on the identified user, it will take you to the page for the users genome.
